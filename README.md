This project explores the dynamics of limit order books and order flow in trading systems. By simulating the behavior of limit orders and their interactions within a market, the project aims to provide a deeper understanding of key metrics such as fill probabilities, expected fill times, and slippage. It also delves into the mechanics of order flow influenced by market liquidity and the application of price-time priority policies for order execution. Through these simulations and analyses, the project offers valuable insights into the efficiency and optimization of trading strategies, highlighting the importance of strategic order placement and execution in financial markets.
